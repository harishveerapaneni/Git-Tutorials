# Learn about Git repositories, what they are, and how to work with commits
## What is a Git Repository?
* A **Git repository** is like a **project folder** that Git is tracking.

* It holds your project's files, **plus** a hidden .git folder where Git stores all **versions** and **history** of your project.

* Repositories can be:

* **Local** (on your machine)

* **Remote** (on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)

## 🛠️ How to Create and Work with a Repository:

### 1.Create a New Repository:
* In your project folder:
```js
bash git init
```
* This sets up the .git directory and makes it a Git repository.

### 2.Clone an Existing Repository (from GitHub, etc.):

* Example:
```js
bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git
```
* This copies the remote project to your machine.

### 📝 What is a Git Commit?
*  A **commit** is like a **snapshot** of your project at a specific point.

* It saves **what has changed** — your updates, new files, deletions, etc.

* Each commit has:

* A unique ID (hash)

* Author info

* Date/time

* A message describing the changes

## 🔥 Basic Workflow for Commits:
### 1.Make Changes:

* Edit, create, or delete files in your repo.

### 2. Check the Status:
```js
bash
git status
```
* Shows what’s changed since the last commit.

### 3. Stage the Changes:
* Add a file:
```js
bash
git add filename.txt

```
* Or add everything:
```js
bash
git add .
```
### 4. Commit the Changes:
```js
bash
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"

```
### 5. View the Commit History:
```js
bash
git log
```

# 📋 Quick Example:
```js
bash
 Quick Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
git init
echo "Hello World" > hello.txt
git add hello.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit: add hello.txt"
```
