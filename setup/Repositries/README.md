## What is a Git Repository?
A **Git repository** is like a **project folder** that Git is tracking.

It holds your project's files, **plus** a hidden .git folder where Git stores all **versions** and **history** of your project.

Repositories can be:

**Local** (on your machine)

**Remote** (on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
